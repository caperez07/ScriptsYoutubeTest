1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,040
hi I'm Taylor Tomlinson and I'm going to

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,000
take you through my camera

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:10,519
roll okay so this is the first

4
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:13,440
photo it is a photo I took on my TV at

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,920
home of the day my last special have it

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,400
all came out on Netflix and it was

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,680
number one in TV shows for I think like

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,240
a day or two I knew it wasn't going to

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,680
be there for long so I said we better

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,920
take a photo of this while it lasts cuz

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,560
that was very cool I love being on lists

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,800
lists are really important to me anytime

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,800
I get to be on a list I try to capture

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,840
that moment this special was different

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,239
from the others for me because all my

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,360
dreams had come true professionally and

17
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,480
I think the first special quarter life

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,920
is like me trying to get to where I am

19
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,840
now look at you is me sort of in the

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,840
middle going is this going to go away

21
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,079
was this a fluke and have it all is me

22
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:55,640
really going yeah I'm I think I'm a real

23
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,480
comedian now I think I did it I think I

24
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,239
did what I set out to do which is really

25
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:00,879
nice have you guys introduced people you

26
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,280
were dating to your parents it's not

27
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,239
about introducing people you love to one

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,920
another is it no it's about showing your

29
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,840
partner why you're mean to them

30
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,119
sometimes

31
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,680
okay this is the second photo okay so

32
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,840
this is a photo of me on tour with Conan

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,560
O'Brien there was a day in Chicago I

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,400
believe there's an American girl I think

35
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,240
the original American Girl doll store is

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,520
in Chicago we were talking about

37
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,560
American Girls when I was on the standup

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,520
tour with Conan and I had had over

39
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,159
shared and said that I never got an

40
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,560
American Girl doll growing up that I

41
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,200
would just look through the catalog cuz

42
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,960
they're so expensive and then the next

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,040
day Conan's social team was like can you

44
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,799
come downstairs Conan's going to give

45
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,399
you a doll and he had me choose between

46
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:45,320
the Samantha doll and the kit doll and I

47
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,520
picked Samantha because I had read more

48
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,560
of her books growing up that's a that's

49
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,840
a little selfie of me and Sam I highly

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,320
recommend having one of your Idols give

51
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,399
you a doll it really helps on tough

52
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,039
days so stupid

53
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:03,280
okay next

54
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,880
photo okay so this photo was me last

55
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,000
year in London doing some shows and I

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,280
had never toured internationally before

57
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,959
which was really exciting I had never

58
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,400
seen Paddington before and my best

59
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,760
friend came with me to the first leg in

60
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,800
London and so we watched Paddington and

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,160
we're like this is the greatest movie

62
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,319
we've ever seen I would not shut up

63
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,040
about it and towards the end of the trip

64
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,760
my friend Dustin Nickerson who opens for

65
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,040
me bought me this Paddington Bear I'm

66
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,840
getting dolls from a lot of people in

67
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,360
this scrapbook I just realized he got me

68
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,319
a little Paddington to remember the trip

69
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,120
by and it made me very emotional and

70
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,680
then I took Paddington around to all of

71
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,760
the major landmarks and took photos of

72
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,360
them so this is one of them next

73
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,200
photo o this is me really living this is

74
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,879
me after I sold out two shows at Radio

75
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,480
City Music Hall which was absolutely

76
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,239
insane and beyond my wildest dreams and

77
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,200
Monday night we all went out and I think

78
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,760
we saw a show and then we went to a

79
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,560
Broadway Bar and you're not supposed to

80
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,879
take videos or photos so it feels very

81
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,560
free in there and someone on my team

82
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,120
just grabbed this real quick but this is

83
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,519
me drunk for the very first time in my

84
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,239
whole life and I really had a great time

85
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,239
look I'm not advocating for abstinence

86
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,560
but I'm glad I waited until I was 29 and

87
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,040
successful to get wasted at a Broadway

88
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,799
Bar it was the right way to go I was

89
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,319
drinking whatever my social media

90
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,959
manager handed me I was like what's that

91
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,040
can I try it get me one I don't know

92
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,879
anything about alcohol I've been drunk

93
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,280
twice ever and I'm like is that good

94
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,640
I'll have

95
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,879
that okay this speaking of international

96
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,959
tour dates so I also got to perform in

97
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,959
Australia last year for the first time

98
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:49,680
which was incredible and when I came

99
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,319
back the jet lag was unimaginable it was

100
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:55,120
terrible and I sort of lost my mind a

101
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,480
little bit I had given myself a few

102
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,239
weeks off and thought I'll rest and then

103
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,560
I couldn't because I was so tired so I

104
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,760
couldn't sleep I was really wired and I

105
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,439
also got weirdly insecure about the fact

106
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,280
that I had no hobbies to turn to when I

107
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,200
had time off on the plane ride back from

108
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,480
Australia I went down a rabbit hole on

109
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,360
Tik Tok watching people decorate cakes

110
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,720
and I thought if I get all the tools

111
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,199
surely I can decorate cakes it's not

112
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,120
that hard you just need all the tools

113
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,600
and I have money so I went and got a

114
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,320
bunch of tools and what you see here is

115
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,039
me trying to decorate a cake we put the

116
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:31,120
beginning stage ages in because it just

117
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,199
goes downhill from here it's really not

118
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,639
good there's a whole miniseries on my

119
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,400
Instagram of me trying to decorate these

120
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,199
cakes at home and it's pretty sad it

121
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,680
never goes well but people seem to find

122
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,880
it entertaining so unfortunately my only

123
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,280
hobby is still creating content and not

124
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,199
actually making anything anyone would

125
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:54,000
want to eat or look at then I put some

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,039
pink sprinkles on it I don't know if I

127
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:59,880
should do more sprinkles it lasted Maybe

128
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,560
two weeks and people still bring it up

129
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,280
to me they're like what happened to that

130
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,960
cake show I was like that was 2 weeks

131
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,240
that wasn't that didn't last that long I

132
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,400
think I only made like four cakes that

133
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,880
was a dark period next

134
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,639
one oh this is me being told by stepen

135
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,440
coar that I got the job hosting after

136
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,160
midnight I was on my way out and I got a

137
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,759
text from my team that was like can you

138
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,160
hop on a zoom with coar and everyone I

139
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,120
think they have a few more questions for

140
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,639
you because I was up for the job and I

141
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,400
had done the screen test the week before

142
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,520
and I thought oh yeah sure that's fine

143
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,639
and I got on and he sort of acted like

144
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,280
he was going to keep interviewing me

145
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,360
he's like there's a couple things I

146
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,000
didn't ask you and I was like okay and

147
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,400
then he totally faked me out and gave me

148
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,680
the job and this is my genuine and

149
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,400
sincere surprise I was so excited I was

150
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,479
so afraid it's crazy that this was only

151
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,800
in November this wasn't that long ago

152
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,280
and I feel so different than I did in

153
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,720
this picture picture I don't feel

154
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,520
differently about getting the job I just

155
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,600
feel different as a person as a result

156
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,880
of having this job and my life is very

157
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,639
different now it's funny to look back at

158
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,800
moments in your life knowing how much it

159
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,880
changed after that I'm really glad

160
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,120
somebody screenshot it on the call which

161
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,759
I really appreciated cuz they're like

162
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,000
you'll probably want to have this and I

163
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:24,960
do this is a photo of me at after

164
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,280
midnight in an outfit I really really

165
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,520
loved I'm so stupid when I got this job

166
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,720
I thought I was going to have to dress

167
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,160
myself so I like went out and bought

168
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,800
suits and I got there and they're like

169
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,680
you're so cute just we'll put these over

170
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,759
here we have a professional when I

171
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,919
started doing the show I was like can I

172
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,479
just wear the same suit every night like

173
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:45,039
the guys do and they're like you really

174
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,880
can't and I was like okay and then I

175
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,080
thought about it and I remember watching

176
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,120
Chelsea Lately and being a teenager and

177
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,000
being like ooh yellow tank top like I do

178
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
remember noticing her outfits like oh my

179
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,319
gosh her hair's up like I do remember

180
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:00,160
that stuff granted Chelsea antlers much

181
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,000
hotter than me so

182
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,560
okay this is my younger sibling and I

183
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,280
watching after midnight in my hotel room

184
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,639
which was the first time I'd watched the

185
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,840
show like I'd only seen Clips really

186
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,840
online or like on links that they'd sent

187
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,720
me I'd never actually watched it on TV

188
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,759
or even like Paramount plus and it was

189
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,000
so crazy to watch it on TV and go like

190
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,240
oh my gosh we filmed that yesterday now

191
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,240
it's just out there and it's happening

192
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,440
and it reminded me of watching like

193
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,599
Whose Line Is It Anyway when I was a kid

194
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:34,080
it really hit me and I was like oh this

195
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,560
is like a fun goofy silly show it just

196
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,000
felt very nostalgic to me so that also

197
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,720
felt significant my siblings and I are

198
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,280
really really close and they're so

199
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,039
lovely and supportive and think it's

200
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,000
cool but also know that I'm a loser

201
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,039
which is the perfect balance and exactly

202
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,159
what you need in your life if you're

203
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,879
going to be in Show Business people

204
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:54,759
going that's cool also you know simmer

205
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:57,759
down like

206
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,000
okay this is is a photo of me in front

207
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,080
of the Winter Garden theater where they

208
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,560
were doing the music man with Hugh

209
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,360
Jackman's signed glove that I really did

210
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,800
bid on and purchase in a charity auction

211
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,360
after the show people asked me if that

212
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,560
story from have it all is true that

213
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,000
picture is my proof that it actually is

214
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,120
and I do remember participating in the

215
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,759
auction it's very exciting have you ever

216
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,440
participated in an auction like one

217
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,319
where people are excited it was

218
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,159
thrilling and then it's over so fast and

219
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,960
you spent so much money but again is for

220
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,919
charity I would never just do an auction

221
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:36,839
for nothing and I got this glove for my

222
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:38,719
manager and there was also Sutton Foster

223
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,839
also signed a glove which I almost kept

224
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:42,800
but I was like no you got these for Judy

225
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,600
after this happened the very next night

226
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,680
I had a show at Town Hall in New York

227
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,040
and I did the first version of that bit

228
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,240
super worth it super worth it definitely

229
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,560
got my money's worth out of that glove

230
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,800
and then last

231
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,040
one this is me at 16 years old doing

232
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,640
standup somewhere that looks illegal I

233
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,800
don't even know where this was I don't

234
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,600
know if it's upstairs upstairs where a

235
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,120
business an apartment a hotel who knows

236
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,480
where this was but I do like this photo

237
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,000
because it shows you how far I've come

238
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,120
career-wise and acne wise anybody who's

239
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,839
made it in this business in the way they

240
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,560
want to it is important to remember how

241
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,200
far you've come and how hard it was to

242
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,640
get there and nothing drives that Point

243
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,079
