really want to get your night going have

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,760
a good time you know you put this song

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,759
on you do it just feels like there's no

12
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:31,880
way you can listen to it not like want

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,840
to party I've been missing kind of like

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,879
when you go to a club you hear a song

15
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:37,800
that's more upbeat that's what I've been

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,680
missing and it's my favorite style too

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,039
of pop music I think it's just where I

18
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,600
feel like I belong in making that music

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,480
and it's got a little bit of that

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,600
nostalgic um 2000s kind of dance thing

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,840
about it and I think that's what's so

22
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,199
refreshing cuz we we've been missing

23
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,760
that I think again I don't know why it's

24
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,520
it's changed but to hear that come back

25
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,680
again it it gives me those like dulo all

26
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,320
that that world of those kind of s i

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,960
loved so much during that era back in a

28
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,080
fresh and modern way with country music

29
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,560
mixed in I think it's amazing I think

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,600
people are going to really freak out

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,759
over this one we set have to make the

32
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:09,799
song of the summer man and I can't

33
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,439
believe you're willing to do it so yeah

34
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,119
yeah it's been the easiest process it's

35
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,119
been so much fun you know going back and

36
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,119
forth with working on the record too has

37
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,400
been just Joy I think it's one of the

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,000
fastest songs I've ever worked on like

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,479
from the start of an idea to sitting

40
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:27,520
here today and having the song within

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,479
like 2 months I think you know so I cut

42
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:31,920
a vocal on it within a week yeah once we

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,399
had it was just like oh sounds perfect I

44
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:36,079
didn't have barely had any notes you

45
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,320
know I was like uh I don't think I even

46
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,159
had it was just sounding amazing build

47
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,079
everything around the vocal right so um

48
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,560
I went in um and and laid all my vocals

49
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,680
down and have a kind of specific process

50
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,159
with doing that and everything I want

51
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,280
every word and every line to be special

52
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,119
so it's it's really a line by line kind

53
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,680
of a a process um until it feels right

54
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,600
like you hear it and then you just kind

55
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,119
of go like ah it sounds like a record

56
00:01:58,119 --> 00:01:59,920
you know for sure and you know when you

57
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,840
write the lyrics on a dance record you

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,759
kind of want to in my world I want to

59
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,759
keep it simple I want it to be very

60
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,959
direct very like Global as well you know

61
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,200
I I feel like people from all over the

62
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,720
world are going to understand this song

63
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,360
it's not that complicated but it's a lot

64
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,519
of fun and it's like like I said

65
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:18,160
straight to the point the combination

66
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,040
also of dance music and Country and big

67
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,319
vocal performers really works well it

68
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,640
feels like an Anthem so and that's that

69
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,959
was the goal yeah I'm always been a fan

70
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,400
of country

71
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,599
combined with dance music you know aich

72
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,840
was definitely one of the first one to

73
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,239
do it and since then you know everyone

74
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,920
realized oh my God this such a good

75
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,239
combination I was missing that kind of

76
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,159
record in my sets and also right now on

77
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,920
the radio we feel like we we we need

78
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,760
some bangers um not saying there's not

79
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,440
out there but I'm I'm just that specific

80
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,879
one that has the high energy higher BPM

81
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,440
straight to the porn guitar the humming

82
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,560
part and all that stuff combining that

83
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,810
kind dance it

84
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,040
[Music]

85
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,920
works the song started off at first uh

86
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,519
just the guitar and that was to kind of

87
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,680
like set the tone of the record like oh

88
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,959
without the thing yeah yeah so the first

89
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,519
time was just the guitars and then the

90
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,760
chorus came in but we changed that later

91
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,000
but so yeah it was this guitars

92
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,920
just sets the tone right away we're here

93
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,840
to have a good

94
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,760
time that's what it sounds like and then

95
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,439
later into the making of this song I

96
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,599
pull up to his trailer in where were we

97
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,280
in Minneapolis I think we're Minneapolis

98
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,120
and I said I think we should start the

99
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,360
song differently I think we should start

100
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,079
with his we call it humming part Game

101
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,599
Changer it was a game changer cuz you

102
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,360
were on the fence about it I we're going

103
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,879
back and forth cuz the guitars are

104
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,519
really really dope and there through the

105
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:02,720
entire song but uh you know when you

106
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,120
play the song you want instantly be like

107
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,480
oh what is that and I felt we got a

108
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,640
better reaction to that by using Nate's

109
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,000
vocal right away in the beginning so

110
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,280
no-brainer so here we

111
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,639
[Music]

112
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,320
go yeah it was so obvious that that was

113
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,040
the right decision because it like he

114
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,960
said it was good with just the guitars

115
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,199
but now it's special and it reinforces

116
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,639
that hook because that hook is really

117
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,240
catchy and really amazing and so you

118
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,520
have it early on like that cuz we're

119
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,840
going into the chorus right away pretty

120
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,919
much but to hear that hook you recognize

121
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:40,280
it again later in the song and you can

122
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,440
sing along with it so I think it was

123
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,240
really smart on your end to do that

124
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,600
should never wait too long for one of

125
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,260
the best parts of the song you

126
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:54,170
[Music]

127
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,440
know to keep building it up without

128
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,360
adding too much before the drop or the

129
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,080
chorus with everything on added this Tom

130
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,039
and intro kick I call it so smart D I

131
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,759
love that for

132
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,759
Vibe it just fit perfectly with the

133
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,050
guitar

134
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,520
[Music]

135
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,639
[Applause]

136
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,160
too I try to

137
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,199
balance your world with my world and I

138
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,440
feel like this intri is of like your

139
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,479
world and then when we go into the drop

140
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,960
we going into more of the dance

141
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,760
[Music]

142
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,360
elements we got a lot of stuff going on

143
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,400
we

144
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,160
got the low kick the top kick very

145
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,680
important in uh pop music I think that

146
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,800
you hear the top kick I feel like if you

147
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,280
don't really have a top kick uh it could

148
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,919
drown in the mix so I always feel like I

149
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,039
always add a top kick even if it barely

150
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,639
needs it just a little

151
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:12,639
bit

152
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,599
so and then we got some

153
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,919
snares it's um combined with a clap

154
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,720
here and gives that heavy hit heavy

155
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,759
snare like I said it's a lot of stuff

156
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,280
going on here so you really have to

157
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,960
balance you know these elements and and

158
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,360
and so nothing

159
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,360
drowns some

160
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,720
basic high

161
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,840
hats and of course the electronic base

162
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,840
that drives the song in the beginning

163
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,120
the Basse wasn't going like this it was

164
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,319
following this rhythm

165
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:02,639
so we'll

166
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,479
go in the first demo but uh I noticed

167
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,080
that having the Bas just going on the

168
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:15,199
one all the time uh gave it a nicer flow

169
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,759
so almost hits harder

170
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,120
yeah instead

171
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,440
of a lot of side chaining you know in

172
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,120
dance music we love that stuff we side

173
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,240
chain everything almost to get that

174
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,569
[Music]

175
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,759
pump the little ahas yeah those are

176
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,800
dope they're important they're like the

177
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,840
small little thing but no but they L

178
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,039
yeah they definitely fill out uh the

179
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:54,240
verse part I try to fill out fill out

180
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,319
like small gaps and make it more fun um

181
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:01,440
and we've done some here oops

182
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:04,759
so together with the vocals it kind of

183
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,919
fills out those small gaps to keep the

184
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,639
energy going CU I think you know the

185
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,080
more we listen to the song we never want

186
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,360
to lose momentum and and and building

187
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,120
and building so with Nate's vocal

188
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,759
here I mean I'm always moving around

189
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,159
quite a bit during my own shows and

190
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:25,960
everything but this one's just like like

191
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,319
a country music you don't see you don't

192
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,639
see a lot of the

193
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,759
and I love that I'm like why aren't we

194
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,240
doing that like in country because it's

195
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,760
a party but like seeing that happen it's

196
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,959
pretty amazing to see a whole SE of

197
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,719
people just going what the f vocal

198
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:39,599
production is so interesting to me yeah

199
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,000
how it goes together like the throws

200
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,479
versus the doubles versus the harmony

201
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,680
versus just just a verb throw like I'll

202
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,560
just go through this second time the

203
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,640
Core is coming so we obviously got the

204
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,070
main lead

205
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,959
[Music]

206
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:58,279
here got some doubles

207
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,789
[Music]

208
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,880
I love this one oh yeah I do the high

209
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,039
[Music]

210
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,399
Oney what really makes the core strong

211
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,320
all these layers you know if I would

212
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,920
mute all this you would feel like

213
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,600
something was missing specifically for

214
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,399
the second time it comes in because

215
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,120
there's so much going on so you need a

216
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,320
lot to push everything up through the

217
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,200
mix the game also make this

218
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,200
[Music]

219
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,240
thing giv that football stadium feeling

220
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,560
that everyone is singing it together you

221
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,720
know what part I love so much that you

222
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,600
did on here too is when you told me that

223
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,399
because there's a part I was like the

224
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,920
violin's really cool that and he's like

225
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,760
no their horns like this part

226
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,440
the way that sounds on the track is

227
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,760
[Music]

228
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,680
insane yeah and it's the same thing

229
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,040
there you know adding stuff to a song

230
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,959
where a lot of stuff is happening it's

231
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:17,040
high energy fast BPM you know everything

232
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,360
going like there's certain things you

233
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,839
like you don't want to add because it

234
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:23,200
could just make it sound terrible you

235
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,720
know or just too much

236
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,020
everywhere in

237
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:34,279
[Music]

238
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,760
well there's a line that that that stood

239
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,360
out to me that was really country was uh

240
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,000
now she got her hands up on my Levis I

241
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,279
mean that's that's that's that's not a

242
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:42,320
pop lyric at all and stuff so that

243
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,839
really connected and resonated with me

244
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,800
and stuff are you wearing Levis now I'm

245
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,279
actually not wearing Levis but I'd say

246
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,399
nine out of 10 days I'm wearing Levis

247
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,880
you know I never wear Levis I don't know

248
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,720
you can go into the second

249
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,240
verse now she got her hands up on

250
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,480
well I guess we kind of have a little

251
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,760
precourse right here I forgot about this

252
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,720
part you really want to try not to make

253
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,880
people sick of the chorus until the song

254
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,959
is finished you know so you always got

255
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,279
to play a little bit of math here and

256
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,680
there figuring like okay how do we bring

257
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,839
back the chorus again without it not

258
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,079
being too obvious and like oh I kind of

259
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,639
knew that this was coming in again and

260
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:28,680
um we stripped everything down added a

261
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,920
preor

262
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,079
that's very simple and give that last I

263
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:35,680
would call it like Arena feeling mhm I

264
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,600
like it like with the chorus just the

265
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,639
guitar one of the guitars uh to give it

266
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,959
the fin final final

267
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,399
moment not to the chorus to the hook

268
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,720
thing exactly I love that you did that

269
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,480
cuz you think cor's right there for sure

270
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,000
exactly I have a little Theory you know

271
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,040
if you're going to bring back the chorus

272
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,399
one last time it needs to feel like it

273
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,200
really belongs there you know not just

274
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,160
do it because it's the like obvious

275
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,639
thing to do and it ends on that that

276
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,639
hookie thing so then when it starts

277
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:12,120
again it's like yeah it could go on Loop

278
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,260
forever it could

279
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:20,480
[Music]

280
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,720
loop I like
